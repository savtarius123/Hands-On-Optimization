# Hands-On-Optimization
A first glimps in the world of linear (integer) programming.  
We learned how to model a problem into a linear program and how to solve it. We learned many approaches and ways to deal with some problems we can encounter such as limited data,  infeasibility, or the need for integer solutions and of course we used optimization solvers like CPLEX and open-source tools such as GLPK or PuLP in Python to implement and solve our linear and integer programs.
In this repository, you will find some problems, their models, and the corresponding solutions, which illustrate different linear and integer programming techniques.
